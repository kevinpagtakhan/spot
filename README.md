# SPOT

Finding parking spaces can be a pain. Studies suggest that up to 30% of downtown drivers may just be looking for a space to park, wasting an average of 3.3 minutes everyday. Ultimately, making traffic situation worse.

Most of us leave for work during the 9-5 window with our cars, leaving our own parking spaces at home empty. Why not have somebody rent it? Let's all buid a community that helps cut cost and improve traffic and parking situations around the city.
